"""
This module contains tests for the `write_payload_local` function from the
`linksiren.impure_functions` module.

The tests cover the following scenarios:
- Successful writing of a text payload to a .txt file.
- Successful writing of a binary payload to a .lnk file.
- Failure to write a text payload to a .txt file due to an exception.
- Failure to write a binary payload to a .lnk file due to an exception.

Fixtures:
- `payload_name_txt`: Provides the name of the text payload file.
- `payload_name_lnk`: Provides the name of the binary payload file.
- `payload_contents`: Provides the contents of the payload.

Test Functions:
- `test_write_payload_local_txt_success`: Tests successful writing of a text payload to a .txt file.
- `test_write_payload_local_lnk_success`: Tests successful writing of a binary payload to a .lnk
    file.
- `test_write_payload_local_txt_failure`: Tests failure to write a text payload to a .txt file due
    to an exception.
- `test_write_payload_local_lnk_failure`: Tests failure to write a binary payload to a .lnk file
    due to an exception.
