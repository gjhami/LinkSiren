"""
Unit tests for the `get_rankings` function from the `linksiren.impure_functions` module.
This module contains tests to verify the behavior of the `get_rankings` function under various
conditions, including successful execution and different types of failures.
Fixtures:
    smb_connection_mock: A mock object for simulating an SMB connection.
    host_target: A fixture that provides a `HostTarget` instance with predefined paths and a mock
    connection.
Tests:
    - test_get_rankings_no_connection: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns an empty dictionary
      when there is no connection.
    - test_get_rankings_connection_failure: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns an empty dictionary
      when the connection attempt fails.
    - test_get_rankings_expand_paths_failure: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns an empty
      dictionary when expanding paths fails.
    - test_get_rankings_review_all_folders_failure: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns an empty
      dictionary when reviewing all folders fails.
    - test_get_rankings_success: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns the correct rankings when
      executed successfully.
    - test_get_rankings_go_fast: Verifies that `get_rankings` returns the correct rankings when
      executed in "go fast" mode with nested folders.
